# SMS_Spam_Detection
SMS Spam Detection is a machine learning project or application designed to identify and filter out spam messages from legitimate SMS text messages. The goal of this project is to build a model that can automatically classify incoming SMS messages as either "spam" (unwanted and often fraudulent messages) or "ham" (legitimate messages).
